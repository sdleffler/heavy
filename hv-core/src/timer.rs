//! Timing and measurement functionality.
//!
//! This module is a modified verion of `ggez::timer`. See the license information below in the
//! source file.
//!
//! As of the current version, Heavy relies on the `miniquad` crate for an update loop, and the
//! `miniquad` event loop is generally capped at 60FPS. However, on some systems, this vsync-capping
//! doesn't function properly or doesn't exist, and the event loop will spiral out of control. In
//! this event or in the event that `miniquad` or whatever backend we're using in the future gains
//! the ability to run without a framerate cap, then this module can be used to restrict framerate
//! (and/or do other timing corrections.)
//!
//! Generally it is advisable to use a fixed timestep even if your game is capable of using a
//! variable timestep and running at over 60FPS; things like physics engines can become wildly
//! unstable if their timestep/delta-t is varying too much between frames. For a more detailed
//! tutorial on how to handle frame timings in games, see
//! <http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/>
