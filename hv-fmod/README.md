# `sludge-fmod-sys`

This crate provides raw, unsafe FFI bindings to the FMOD Core + Studio APIs, 
generated by bindgen.

This crate currently only supports finding FMOD on Windows and Linux. Set the `WINDOWS_PATH` or `LINUX_PATH`
as needed depending on the target OS that this is being built for

## Building for Windows
1. Download and install fmod (found [here](https://www.fmod.com/download), only FMOD engine, which is part of the FMOD Studio Suite is needed, this library has been tested with version `2.01.05`).
2. Modify the `WINDOWS_PATH` in `build.rs` to match wherever you installed fmod (this should work by default).

## Building for Linux
1. Download and decompress fmod (found [here](https://www.fmod.com/download), only FMOD engine, which is part of the FMOD Studio Suite is needed, this library has been tested with version `2.01.05`).
2. Move the decompressed folder to wherever you want to keep your fmod download and modify the `LINUX_PATH` variable in `build.rs` to match.
3. Add `<fmod_path>/studio/lib/x86_64`, `<fmod_path>/fsbank/lib/x86_64`, and `<fmod_path>/core/lib/x86_64`
to your shell's `*rc` file (typically this will be `~/.bashrc`).
